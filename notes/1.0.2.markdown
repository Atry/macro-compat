This is the final release of [macro-compat-1.0.2][macro-compat].

These release notes provide a summary of changes since macro-compat 1.0.1.

* There are multiple problems with `RangePositions` in Scala 2.10.5. As
  as a workaround these are now stripped from user macro result trees if
  the `-Yrangepos` compiler flag is enabled.

* Bundle classes can now have parent traits/abstract classes.

* Support for `Context#internal.constantType` has been added.

* [Phil Wills][philwills] fixed a bug in the `companion` method on
  `Type`.

Many thanks to everyone who has contributed ideas, enthusiasm and
encouragement.
