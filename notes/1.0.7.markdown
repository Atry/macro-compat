This is the final release of [macro-compat-1.0.7][macro-compat].

Binary compatibility was broken in 1.0.3 and again in 1.0.6. In version 1.0.7 binary compatability with 1.0.3-5 has
been restored and 1.0.6 is now deprecated. The binary compatibility breaking changes have been moved to 1.1.0 and
hopefully the addition of [MiMa][mima] to the build will make a recurrence of this sort of breakage much less likely
in future.

These release notes provide a summary of changes since macro-compat 1.0.6.

+ Restored binary compatibility with versions 1.0.3-5.

+ Added [MiMa][mima] to the build.

Many thanks to everyone who has contributed ideas, enthusiasm and encouragement.
