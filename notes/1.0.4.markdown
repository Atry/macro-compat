This is the final release of [macro-compat-1.0.4][macro-compat].

These release notes provide a summary of changes since macro-compat 1.0.3.

* Added Symbol#isConstructor; whitespace.

* Added Symbol#info and infoIn.

* Added Type#decl and Context#internal.enclosingOwner.

* Added compileTimeOnly annotation (thanks to [Alistair Johnson][inthenow]).

* On 2.11.x the @bundle annotation is now implemented as a macro annotation which leaves its annottees unchanged. This
  completely eliminates all traces of macro-compat on 2.11.x builds. Thanks to [Eugene Burmako][xenoby] for the
  suggestion.

Many thanks to everyone who has contributed ideas, enthusiasm and
encouragement.
